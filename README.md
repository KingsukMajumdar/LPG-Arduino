# LPG-Arduino
“LPG Sensor Incorporating Microcontroller and Arduino UNO”
The leakage of dangerous and flammable gas like LPG in cars, service stations, households and in storage tanks can be detected using the gas sensor unit. This unit can be easily integrated into a unit that can sound an alarm. 


The sensor has great sensitivity and rapid response time. This sensor can also be used to sense other gases like iso-butane, and propane.


The sensor detects leakage in the surrounding and sends signal to Arduino board in which the microcontroller is inbuilt. The buzzer is turned on and the MCB is tripped, which isolates the main electric supply of the house.


With the help of the laptop and Arduino software (IDE) platform, which is an open-source software user can modify a lot of things and can also monitor the status of the circuit which can be also possible by LED display also.
